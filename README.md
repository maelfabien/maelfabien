# Hi there ! 👌

Welcome to my GitHub. My name is Maël and I'm a Data Scientist and  Ph.D. student at Idiap research institute (EPFL) in Speech Processing 🗣, on [ROXANNE European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/), a project that leverages real-time analytics for combating organized crime 🤖💀. I'm also a blogger, and my blog can be accessed here:

Outside of Data Science, my interests are:
- Traveling 🧳 : I have been traveling to South East Asia, New Zealand, Tahiti and Chile with my girlfriend for the past 4 months. I have posted pictures of the trip in the Travel section. 
- Sports 🚴‍♂️: Hiking in Switzerland, running on the beach in Britanny, practicing Fitness/Crossfit. I used to play volleyball and have been Swiss national champion in Junior. I also used to (and still do sometimes) practice javelin. I won several times the Javelin Championship in Rhône-Alpes region in Junior (± 50 meters).
- Animals 🐶🐱🐭 : I have been vegetarian for close to 4 years, love animals and support several associations.
- Reading/Learning 💻: I spend most of my free time trying to learn stuffs. I try to do 1 online course per month, although I don't always manage to do so.
- Entrepreneurship 💡: I launched a first startup project during my Master and got some money from an entrepreneurial contest in Lausanne. I was invited at the 2018 final of this contest to share my experience on stage. I won a hackathon in 2019, but did not convert it to a proper project.

I have a B.Sc. in Economics and an M.Sc. in Actuarial Science both from the University of Lausanne (HEC Faculty). I don’t expect many people to know what actuarial science is, but to keep it short, it’s mostly applied mathematics and statistics for the insurance sector. I worked for 6 months in an insurance company, developed a large interest in Machine Learning and programming, and joined Telecom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France) for a Specialized Master in Data Science. I finished this degree in 2019. I am now a Ph.D. student in Speech Processing at EPFL's Idiap Lab (start March 2020).

I did an internship as a Data Scientist at [Anasen](https://anasen.com/), a Y-Combinator startup in Paris. I previously interned at [Veamly](https://veamly.com/) in NLP. Outside of that, I'm a Machine Learning instructor at [VivaData](https://vivadata.org/), an AI Bootcamp in Paris, [Stat4Decision](https://www.stat4decision.com/en/) and [Dakar Insitute of Technology](https://dit.sn/). I also write articles about AI for [Digital Minds](https://www.digitalminds.io/), [Explorium](https://www.explorium.ai/), [Stat4Decision](https://www.stat4decision.com/en/) and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mael.fabien). My technical interests are:
- Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Statistics in general
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Processing
- A bit of data engineering, since I'd like my next professional experience to be as a Machine Learning Engineering

I started this blog in September 2018 for several reasons:
- Writing helps me understand. Pictures and schemas too. I am trying to combine both in my articles.
- I did most of my studies in English, although it's not my native language. This blog is a way to keep writing.
- Data Science is moving fast. Reading about AI-related news could be a full-time job. I learn best by doing projects. So I post most of them here.
- I forget stuff, so it's always good to have them written down in a single place.
- If this blog can help someone else, this really makes my day.

You can [contact me](mailto:mael.fabien@gmail.com) if you think we could work together on an article or a project, or if you have any question/remark. If you would like to get to know more about me and my projects, feel free to check out my [resume](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/files/CV_MF.pdf). I'm uploading articles that I'm writing in my free time. I'm trying to upload one article per week on average.
