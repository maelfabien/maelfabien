# Hi there !

My name is MaÃ«l and I'm the CEO and co-founder of [biped.ai](https://biped.ai), a smart navigation harness for blind and visually impaired people. I was previously a Ph.D. student at EPFL in Speech Processing. I also write articles, and have a technical blog ([here](https://maelfabien.github.io/)). Mixed background in Economics, Statistics and Data Science, with an entrepreneurial spirit and a strong will to have an impact. I'm uploading some projects of mine here. All my links [here](https://linktr.ee/maelf).
