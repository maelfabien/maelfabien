# Hi there ! 🤗

Welcome to my GitHub. My name is Maël and I'm a Data Scientist and  Ph.D. student at Idiap research institute (EPFL) in Speech Processing 🗣, on [ROXANNE European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/), a project that leverages real-time analytics for combating organized crime 🤖💀. I'm spending a good part of my time working on [SoundMap](https://soundmap.io/), an assistive device that guides blind and visually impaired people using advanced computer vision. Finally, Ilove writing articles, and have a technical blog ([here](https://maelfabien.github.io/)). 


Outside of Data Science, my interests are:
- Traveling 🧳 : I have been traveling around Western Africa, South East Asia, New Zealand, Tahiti, North America and Chile with my girlfriend
- Sports 🚴‍♂️: Hiking in Switzerland, running on the beach in Britanny, practicing Fitness/Crossfit. I used to play volleyball and have been Swiss national champion in Junior. I also used to (and still do sometimes) practice javelin.
- Animals 🐶🐱🐭 : I have been vegetarian for close to 4 years, moving to a fully vegan diet, I love animals and support several associations.
- Reading/Learning 💻: I spend most of my free time trying to learn stuffs (current thing is piano).
- Entrepreneurship 💡: I launched a first startup project during my Master and got some money from an entrepreneurial contest in Lausanne. I was invited at the 2018 final of this contest to share my experience on stage. I won a hackathon in 2019, but did not convert it to a proper project. I won another hackathon in 2020, and that eventually became SoundMap.

I have a B.Sc. in Economics and an M.Sc. in Actuarial Science both from the University of Lausanne (HEC Faculty) ( applied mathematics and statistics for the insurance sector). I worked for 6 months in an insurance company, developed a large interest in Machine Learning and programming, and joined Telecom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France) for a second Masters in Data Science. I finished this degree in 2019. 

I'm uploading there some of my personal projects, among which a repo of ML resources, an emotion recognition application, a voice assistant and much more.
